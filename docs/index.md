# About

The **Feldfreund DevKit** is an open-source platform for autonomous outdoor robotics developed by [Zauberzeug GmbH](https://zauberzeug.com).
Built on [RoSys](https://rosys.io), an all-Python robot system framework with built-in simulation, hardware abstraction, and a real-time web interface via [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).
Time-critical and safety-critical behavior runs on the microcontroller via [Lizard](https://lizard.dev), a domain-specific language for embedded hardware control.

Our agricultural weeding robot [Feldfreund](https://zauberzeug.com/feldfreund) is based on this platform and is intended to advance organic and regenerative agriculture.

**This documentation is currently work in progress while we try to expand this library.**

Stay tuned and please [report any issues on Github](https://github.com/zauberzeug/feldfreund_devkit/issues).

## Features

- **Open Source** — modify and enhance the software to fit your specific needs.
- **Modular Design** — equip with tools from Zauberzeug, third-party solutions, or custom developments.
- **ROS2 Support** — a [ROS2 implementation](https://github.com/zauberzeug/feldfreund_devkit_ros) is available.
